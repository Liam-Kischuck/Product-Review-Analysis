# Product Review Analysis

## Description

This project analyses the Amazon fine foods prodcut review data set. So far, I have analysed the memory coefficient of the product review patterns in Product_Market_Memory_Analysis.ipynb.
Memory effects can appear in activity patterns, such as in earthquakes and weather patterns [1]. The memory coefficient $\mu$ ($-1\leq \mu \leq  1$), is defined as the the correlation coefficient of all consecutive interevent time
values in the signal over a population, and can capture these memory effects. So far in this part of the project, I have looked at the relationship between the memory coefficient of the product reviews and other
properties of the reviews such as the average rating of the products.
